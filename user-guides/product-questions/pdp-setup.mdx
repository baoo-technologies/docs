description: "How to configure and generate sample questions for product detail pages (PDP) — including setup, URL selection, sitemap/CSV import, and frontend integration."
---

<Note>
  **Goal:** Generate short, helpful sample questions (typically 3–5) for
  selected product pages. The frontend fetches these publicly via API and
  renders them only if a valid set exists.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- You’re working within an **Organization**.
- Optionally, you’ve identified your most visited or most asked-about PDPs.

---

## 1) Configuration

Navigate to one of your Assistants and select **Product Questions**. Click **Setup now** to begin the initial configuration. This setup defines how sample questions are generated and which domains may access them.

### Configuration options

| Setting                                  | Required   | Description                                                                                                 | Recommendation                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number of generated sample questions** | ✓ Required | Determines how many questions are auto-generated per product page.                                          | **3–5** questions provide a good balance between user engagement and UI clarity.                     |
| **Domains / Origins**                    | ✓ Required | Whitelist of domains allowed to fetch question sets. At least one domain must be added.                     | Add your production domain(s) to ensure only authorized origins can access your generated questions. |
| **Additional Rules for Generation**      | ○ Optional | Custom instructions that guide the AI when generating questions (e.g., tone, focus areas, excluded topics). | Useful if you want brand-specific phrasing or to emphasize certain product attributes.               |

## 2) Add product pages

Click **Create** to add new product pages. You can choose from three import methods:

  className="rounded-lg shadow"
/>

### A) Single URL

Enter a product page URL directly and click **Add**. Ideal for adding individual high-priority pages.

### B) Sitemap

Select a domain to scan its sitemap. Homie automatically parses the sitemap and extracts only product detail pages.

### C) CSV Import

Upload a CSV file containing your product URLs. The file must include a column named **`url`** — this is the only column that will be processed.

<Note>
  You can combine all three methods — start with your top PDPs manually and
  later expand via sitemap or CSV to scale up.
</Note>

---

## 3) Generate questions

Once your list is ready, click **Generate**. Homie processes all URLs in the background — duplicates are automatically detected and skipped. Depending on the number of URLs, this may take a few minutes.

The result table shows each product with its generated questions, timestamp, and how often they've been requested by your frontend.

<Tip>
  Start with 20–50 top-performing PDPs (high traffic, frequent inquiries).
  Evaluate usage and refine before scaling across your full catalog.
</Tip>

---

## 4) Display

There are two ways to display the generated questions on your product pages:

### Shopify

1. Open the **Shopify Theme Editor**.
2. Navigate to a **product page**.
3. Click **Add Section** in the sidebar.
4. Under **Apps**, select the **Homie Product Questions** component.
5. Drag the block to your desired position (e.g., below the product description).

<Note>
  Make sure questions have already been generated for the product you're
  previewing. Otherwise, only an empty section will be displayed.
</Note>

### Manual Integration

Add the following HTML element to your page template. Place it wherever you want the questions to appear:

```html
<div id="homie-product-questions"></div>
```

<Note>
  The main assistant script automatically detects this element and populates it
  with the generated questions.
