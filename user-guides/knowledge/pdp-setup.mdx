title: "Setting up PDP Questions"
description: "How to configure and generate sample questions for product detail pages (PDP) — including setup, URL selection, sitemap/CSV import, and frontend integration."
---

<Note>
  **Goal:** Generate short, helpful sample questions (typically 4–6) for
  selected product pages. The frontend fetches these publicly via API and
  renders them only if a valid set exists.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- You’re working within an **Organization**.
- Optionally, you’ve identified your most visited or most asked-about PDPs.

---

## 1) Configure your base setup

Open **Settings → Product Questions** to define the general setup:

- **Number of generated sample questions**: Recommended **4–6**.
- **Question generation rules** (optional):
  - **Language:** same as the product page.
  - **Variety:** cover different intents (e.g. _technical term, benefits, target_audience, compatibility, usage, limitations, value_price, availability_shipping, warranty_support, alternatives_).
  - **Concreteness:** use real product facts (features, specs, price, dimensions, material, compatibility, accessories, warranty).
  - **Prioritization:** rank by purchase relevance (**1 = most important**).
  - **No answers**, only questions. **No duplicates.**
  - **Keep it short:** ≤ 50 characters per question.

<Tip>
  In most cases, the **default ruleset** works best. Only adjust if you have
  specific editorial requirements (e.g., tone, phrasing, or exclusions).
</Tip>

### Optional: Product Page Regex

If your shop follows a consistent URL pattern, you can specify a **regex pattern**
to detect product detail pages, e.g.  
`^https?:\/\/(www\.)?example\.com\/products\/[a-z0-9-]+\/?$`.

If left empty, Homie automatically applies heuristics (canonical URL + metadata).

### Optional: Domains / Origins

You can whitelist which domains are allowed to fetch PDP question sets from
the public API (CORS). Leave blank for no restrictions.

## 2) Select your product pages

Open the **Product Question Assistant** and choose one of three methods:

<div className=" my-6">
  <img
    src="/images/knowledge/pdp-setup.png"
    alt="PDP-Setup-Page"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

### A) Single URL

Enter one PDP URL and click **Add to list**.

### B) Sitemap

Switch to the **Sitemap** tab → provide your `sitemap.xml` (ideally your
Product Sitemap).  
Homie automatically extracts URLs and shows a preview before you import them.

### C) CSV Import

Switch to the **CSV** tab → upload a CSV file.  
We only look for a column named **`url`** (fallback: **`link`**).

<Warning>
  Only include **product detail pages**. Category pages, search results, or CMS
  pages generally don’t generate meaningful questions.
</Warning>

<Note>
  You can mix methods — start with your top PDPs manually and later expand via
  sitemap or CSV to scale up.
</Note>

---

## 3) Send list & generate questions

Once your list is ready, click **Send list**.  
Homie queues all URLs, **canonicalizes**, **deduplicates**, and generates
questions asynchronously.

- **Duration:** depends on batch size and source type.
- **Idempotent:** each canonical URL is generated once.
- **Ranking:** questions are sorted by `rank` (1 = highest priority).

In the result table you’ll see:

- **Product / URL**
- **Questions** (count)
- **Generated at**
- **Requests** (frontend fetches)

<Tip>
  Start with 20–50 top-performing PDPs (high traffic, frequent inquiries).
  Evaluate usage and refine before scaling across your full catalog.
</Tip>

## 4) Frontend integration (public API)

Your frontend — or our widget — fetches question sets via a public endpoint:

**Endpoint**  
`POST https://api.yourhomie.ai/v1/knowledge/pdp-questions/public/get-questions`

**Request body (example)**

```json
{
  "url": "https://shop.example.com/p/product-abc-12345",
  "organizationId": "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
}
```
