description: "Invite colleagues and control permissions in your Homie AI workspace — secured by BetterAuth."

<Note>
  Every Homie account represents **one workspace (team)**. You can’t create
  additional teams, but you can invite unlimited teammates.
</Note>

## Where to manage members

1. Open **Settings** in the main navigation.
2. Select **Members** in the left‑hand tab bar.
3. Use the **Invite** form at the top of the page.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-6">
  <img
    src="/images/team-invite.png"
    alt="Invite new member form"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
  <img
    src="/images/team-roles.png"
    alt="Role selection (Member vs Admin)"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

<Warning>
  Invitation links are valid for **24 hours**. If they expire, simply send a new
  one — the old link becomes invalid.
</Warning>

## Roles & permissions

Homie keeps it simple: **Member** and **Admin**.

| Capability                               | Member | Admin |
| ---------------------------------------- | :----: | :---: |
| View & train AI assistants               |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Manage knowledge sources                 |   ✅   |  ✅   |
| Create / delete assistants               |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite / remove members                  |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Change billing, plan, workspace settings |   ❌   |  ✅   |

<Tip>
  Need more fine‑grained control? Role‑based API keys let you restrict actions
  programmatically. See the [API auth guide](/developer‑guides/authentication).
