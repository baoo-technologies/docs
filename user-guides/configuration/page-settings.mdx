<Note>
  Page Settings allow you to create a more personalized experience by
  customizing chatbot behavior for different sections of your website. Use URL
  patterns with wildcards to target multiple pages at once.
</Note>

---

## Overview

Page Settings let you define specific configurations for URLs that match a pattern. This enables you to:

- Show different welcome messages on different pages
- Display custom proactive popup messages based on page context
- Provide page-specific example questions
- Hide the chatbot on specific pages
- Create more personalized interactions for your customers

For example, on a search page, you could ask customers if they need help with their search, or on `/services` pages, ask if they're looking for a specific service.

## URL Patterns

<Warning>
  You must specify the **full URL path** including the domain (e.g.,
  `https://yourshop.com/search/*`). Path-only patterns (like `/search/*`) will
  not work. Only `/*` can be used as a wildcard — single `*` without the forward
  slash will not work.
</Warning>

You can use wildcards (`/*`) in your URL patterns to match multiple pages:

| Pattern                           | Matches                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://yourshop.com/search/*`   | All pages starting with `/search` (e.g., `https://yourshop.com/search?q=shoes`, `https://yourshop.com/search/results`) |
| `https://yourshop.com/products/*` | All product detail pages                                                                                               |
| `https://yourshop.com/services/*` | All pages starting with `/services`                                                                                    |
| `https://yourshop.com/checkout`   | Only the exact `/checkout` page                                                                                        |

<Tip>
  Use `/*` wildcards to configure behavior for entire sections of your website
  without creating individual rules for each page. Make sure to include the full
  domain (e.g., `https://yourshop.com`) at the beginning of your pattern, and
  use `/*` (not just `*`) for wildcard matching.
</Tip>

## Basic Configuration

After creating a URL pattern, you can configure the following settings:

### Hide Chatbot

Enable this option to completely hide the chatbot on pages matching this URL pattern.

<div className="my-4">
  <img
    src="/images/configuration/hide-chatbot.png"
    alt="Hide chatbot toggle option"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

### Initial Message

Set a custom welcome message that appears when the chat is first opened. This overrides the default welcome message for pages matching this URL pattern.

You can format text using **bold** or _italic_ markdown syntax.

<div className="my-4">
  <img
    src="/images/configuration/initial-message.png"
    alt="Initial message configuration"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

**Example:**

```
Welcome! Need help finding the perfect product? I'm here to assist you.
```

### Suggested Messages

Provide custom example questions or prompts that appear as quick-reply buttons in the chat interface. Each line corresponds to one suggested message.

<div className="my-4">
  <img
    src="/images/configuration/suggested-messages.png"
    alt="Suggested messages configuration"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

**Example:**

```
What are your shipping options?
Do you have this in a different size?
How do I track my order?
```

---

## Proactive Message Configuration

Proactive messages appear before the customer opens the chat, helping you engage visitors at the right moment.

### Settings

<div className="my-4">
  <img
    src="/images/configuration/proactive-message.png"
    alt="Proactive message configuration"
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

#### Hide Standard Proactive Message

Enable this to hide the default proactive message on this page and show only your custom message.

#### Message

Enter the text that will be displayed in the proactive popup. This message appears before the chat is opened.

#### Batches (Optional)

Define multiple message variations that can be rotated. Each line corresponds to one batch variant. This is useful for A/B testing different messages.

**Example:**

```
Need help finding something? Let me assist you!
Looking for a specific product? I can help!
Can I help you with your search?
```

#### Type

Choose when the proactive message should appear:

- **Scroll Depth** — Triggers when the user scrolls to a certain percentage of the page
- **Time on Page** — Triggers after the user has been on the page for a certain duration
- **Page View** — Triggers immediately when the page loads

#### Threshold

The value that triggers the proactive message, combined with the unit:

- For **Scroll Depth**: Percentage (0-100)
- For **Time on Page**: Seconds
- For **Page View**: N/A (triggers immediately)

#### Delay (Optional)

Add a delay before showing the proactive message, even if the trigger condition is met. Useful for giving users time to interact with the page first.

#### Repeat After (Optional)

Define how long to wait before showing the proactive message again if the user dismisses it. This prevents the message from being too intrusive.

#### Active

Toggle to enable or disable this proactive message. Useful for temporarily disabling messages without deleting the configuration.

## Use Cases

### Search Page

Create a URL pattern for `https://yourshop.com/search/*` and configure:

- **Initial Message**: "Hi! Need help finding something? I can assist you with your search."
- **Suggested Messages**:
  ```
  How do I filter products?
  What are the best sellers?
  Do you have free shipping?
  ```
- **Proactive Message**: "Looking for something specific? Let me help you find it!" (triggers at 30% scroll depth)

### Services Page

For `https://yourshop.com/services/*` pages:

- **Initial Message**: "Welcome! Are you looking for a specific service? I can provide more information."
- **Suggested Messages**:
  ```
  What services do you offer?
  How much does it cost?
  How long does it take?
  ```
- **Proactive Message**: "Interested in our services? I can answer your questions!" (triggers after 10 seconds)

### Checkout Page

For `https://yourshop.com/checkout`:

- **Hide Standard Proactive Message**: Enabled (to avoid distraction during checkout)
- **Initial Message**: "Almost done! Need help with payment or shipping options?"
- **Suggested Messages**:
  ```
  What payment methods do you accept?
  How long is shipping?
  Can I change my delivery address?
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Start simple**: Begin with a few high-traffic pages and expand based on performance
- **Test messages**: Use batches to A/B test different proactive messages
- **Don't be intrusive**: Use delays and thresholds to show messages at appropriate times
- **Match context**: Ensure your messages are relevant to the page content
- **Monitor performance**: Review chat analytics to see which configurations perform best

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Message not showing?** Check that the URL pattern matches your page URLs exactly, including the full domain (e.g., `https://yourshop.com/search/*`) and any query parameters if needed
- **Wildcard not working?** Ensure you use `/*` (not just `*`) as the wildcard pattern and that you've included the full URL path starting with `https://`
- **Proactive message too frequent?** Adjust the "Repeat After" setting to increase the interval
- **Configuration not applying?** Verify that the "Active" toggle is enabled for proactive messages
